# Numerical precision in Mathics

Mathics3 10.0.1 evaluates the tested `FindRoot` seeds and Newton updates at
machine precision despite a supplied `WorkingPrecision`. Before the package
adapter, `InverseNumericalCheck` could therefore label a machine-precision
reference root as high-precision numerical evidence. The independent
[precision audit](../../validation/mathics-numerical-precision-audit.json)
retains the exact programs and original outputs for a rational root, an
irrational quadratic root, and an integer root.

The Mathics-only late adapter redirects `FindRoot` in the five package-owned
numerical comparison consumers. If the requested reference-root precision
goal exceeds the demonstrated machine capability, it returns
`Failure["MathicsNumericalPrecisionUnavailable", ...]` instead of successful
comparison evidence. Delegated roots are also checked for sufficient returned
precision. This is an explicit compatibility limitation: arbitrary-precision
reference-root computation remains available in the official Wolfram kernel.

There is one exact exception. A seed that denotes an exact integer or
rational can be recognized as an exact root by direct substitution into an
exact polynomial equation. The adapter takes the integer the seed equals, or
otherwise the rational the seed denotes exactly (`Rationalize[seed, 0]`, which
returns `1/2` for `0.5` and `1/3` for a forty-digit `0.333...`), proves the
substituted polynomial is exactly zero, and returns that number as the
reference root before the consumer's requested numerical conversion. A seed
whose rational reading does not satisfy the equation exactly, such as an
approximation of `Sqrt[2]`, is refused as before; no precision is added to
unverified digits (wave-5 report 45 N01).

For example, after loading the package in a separate input:

```wl
$IterationLimit = 1000000;
s = AsymptoticInverse[x^2, {x, Infinity}, {y, 1}];
InverseNumericalCheck[s, 4, WorkingPrecision -> 30]
InverseNumericalCheck[s, 2, WorkingPrecision -> 30]
```

The first check verifies the exact seed `2` and returns its reference root at
30-digit precision. The second needs the irrational reference root `Sqrt[2]`
and returns the explicit Mathics precision failure. The inverse of `3 x` at
target `1` now returns the exact root `1/3` at precision 30 through the
rational-seed exception, and a request with `WorkingPrecision -> 10` succeeds
with a machine root meeting its precision goal. These are bounded examples,
not a guarantee for every low-precision input, convergence condition, or
special inverse family.

## Logarithms of small products

Arbitrary-precision `N[Log[c r], n]` returns `Indeterminate` on the tested
interpreter when `c` is an irrational constant and the rational `r` is below
about `10^-17`; `N[Log[Sqrt[2]/10^16], 40]` evaluates while
`N[Log[Sqrt[2]/10^17], 40]` does not, and `N[Log[Sqrt[Pi]] + Log[10^-20], 40]`
evaluates. The same late adapter therefore also redirects `N` in the five
numerical consumers: when an evaluation returns `Indeterminate`, it retries
with every `Log` of a product whose factors an exact positive grammar proves
positive rewritten as the sum of their logarithms, and otherwise returns the
first value unchanged. The rewrite is valid for positive real factors, which
is the real-branch situation in which these logarithmic target coordinates
arise. The grammar admits positive integers and rationals, the named positive
constants (`Pi`, `E`, `EulerGamma`, `Catalan`, `GoldenRatio`, `Degree`,
`Glaisher`, `Khinchin`), sums and products of admitted factors, integer and
rational powers of admitted factors, `E` to an exact rational power, and the
logarithm of a rational above `1`. A machine-precision sign is not used: it
rounds an exact rational below the double underflow threshold, such as
`10^-400`, to zero and would block a valid split, and it can round an exactly
negative factor such as `Pi - 314159265358979323847/10^20` to a positive
number and would license a false principal-branch identity. Any other factor
leaves the logarithm unsplit; the portable case
`numerical-log-split-uses-exact-positive-factors` pins the grammar.
Values that still contain `Indeterminate` are rejected by the consumers'
finite-value guards instead of reaching a realness comparison, which would
abort the Mathics evaluator.

Exact symbolic specialization, asymptotic remainders, interval certificates,
and numerical root comparisons have different contracts. This adapter changes
only package numerical reference-root calls on Mathics. Direct caller uses of
`FindRoot`, installed interpreter definitions, and official Wolfram loading
and numerical behavior retain their existing dispatch. Nonprincipal Lambert
values have additional [evaluation limitations](ALGEBRA.md).
