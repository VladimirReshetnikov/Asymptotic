# Mathics public API coverage

This inventory maps all **38 exported symbols** to representative cases in
[the portable suite](../../validation/MathicsTests.wl). A row records a tested
operation. It does not establish compatibility for
every input, option, branch, precision, or resource limit of that symbol.
The [compatibility status](COMPATIBILITY.md) describes the broader goal.

## Evidence and current scope

The maintained suite has **141 cases** (`run_mathics_tests.py --list`) after the loading-lifecycle, adapter-postcondition and parametric-domain cases, wave-4 hardening, the omitted-interval certificate diagnostic, the Zeta truncation bound transport, and the exact affine certificate translation, the local-coordinate numerical check, explicit coefficient power precedence, the residual offset label, the four explicit special-function adapters with the Erfc numerical contract, the wave-6 protector, positive-grammar and rational-seed cases, the two-sided `Limit` and `FirstPosition` option-grammar cases, the report-63 logarithmic certificate witnesses, the wave-4 W4-03 tiny-neighbourhood condition with its eventual-sign certificate primitives, and the W4-08 hypergeometric defining-series cases. The additional
contracts cover empty lookup state, shared lazy defaults, the empty inverse multi-index, retained
nonprincipal `ProductLog` proofs, and numerical precision. The quadratic
integer-root test now also verifies the returned precision. Focused paired
Windows checks are recorded separately in the
[validation index](../../validation/README.md#mathics-wave-4-hardening);
the complete historical acceptance below applies to its exact 101-case suite.

All **101 cases at that checkpoint pass in both package layouts on Linux** at the fixed
checkpoint `ffe08b1`. The [full acceptance record](../../validation/mathics-linux-ffe08b1-acceptance.json)
checks all ten downloaded shards against that commit's package, suite and
runner hashes and independently validates their raw kernel protocol. Each
case occurs exactly once per layout. Subsequent upstream principal-logarithm
changes have separate focused Mathics and native-preservation records; the
full run is evidence for its stated commit. These are representative public
contracts, not every possible input or the original MUnit suite.

The historical Windows batches below preserve the development evidence.
The first 77 cases have complete
modular and standalone runs on the recorded earlier source snapshots. Each
full run reported **76 successes and one failure** in the exact-normalization
assertion for `inverse-perturbative-formula`. Replacing `Expand` with `Simplify`
proved the same expected exact zero; the corrected case then passed on both
unchanged package snapshots. The original failing receipts are retained.
This is reconciled evidence for 77 cases, not a claim that either full run
originally passed all 77. Those snapshots contained 53 kernel modules.

Thirteen additional cases covering public operations and the empty-list
`Map` regression passed on both modular and standalone snapshots containing
54 modules. Their package hashes differ from the earlier 77-case snapshots.
The four remaining direct-export cases and four held inline-assumption
contracts passed on both layouts of the recorded 55-module candidate; the
standalone batch also repeated its five loading cases. Together, these
receipts cover 98 unique cases per layout across three package snapshots.
Three further cases for Newton inversion, retained Newton refinement,
additional-block requests and product-recipe replay passed on the same
55-module modular and standalone snapshots and in the original Wolfram
kernel. The full aggregate now covers **101 unique cases per layout across
three package snapshots**. All 101 expectations at that stage have original Wolfram
controls, across separate batches. This historical aggregate remains separate
from the subsequent complete Linux run and does not combine different package
snapshots into one acceptance claim.

The [Wolfram preservation audit](../../validation/mathics-wolfram-preservation.json),
under `PortableOriginalOracleCheck`, reports original-Wolfram controls for
all 101 expectations across separate batches. It includes batch counts,
selected test IDs and observed outputs for the three refinement cases.
Complete portable-run Wolfram receipts containing every case's actual and
expected output are not published alongside the Mathics receipts; the
101-case control claim is the audit's reported aggregate, not an independently
reconstructed union of complete per-case receipts.

The [machine-readable evidence summary](../../validation/mathics-test-coverage.json)
records each receipt's exact byte hash, normalized comparison hash, package
source fingerprint, original
outcome and reconciliation. Its underlying [full modular](../../validation/mathics-modular-tests.json)
and [full standalone](../../validation/mathics-standalone-tests.json) receipts
remain unchanged. The [summary generator](../../validation/summarize_mathics_tests.py)
rejects reconciliations between different package sources or with unresolved
original failures. Additional operation receipts retain their own source scope.
Schema version 3 retains `ReceiptSHA256` as the hash of the exact receipt
bytes. It additionally computes `NormalizedReceiptSHA256` after replacing
CRLF with LF, with all other bytes unchanged; both policies are explicit
in the corresponding `*Normalization` fields. The normalized hash allows
comparison across line-ending variants without claiming their raw bytes
are identical. Each receipt still retains the exact
package and suite byte hashes used for its run, including historical CRLF
snapshots. The summary copies those source hashes without normalization;
publishing the current suite with LF does not make its bytes identical to a
historical tested snapshot.

The [portable validation contracts](PORTABLE-VALIDATION.md) explain the
runner's source-fingerprint and loading limits, case-selection semantics,
and what the acceptance verifier adds to a saved receipt.
The initial publication checkpoint `bc6d570` normalized those receipt files
to LF. The publication correction restores their captured bytes and marks
`validation/mathics-*-tests.json` with `-text`, so Git preserves their recorded
hashes before final acceptance.

The following labels identify the historical Windows batches. The complete Linux run
also passes every case listed below on its single recorded source snapshot.

- **Core**: first 77 cases, with the explicit exact-normalization reconciliation above.
- **Operations**: the additional 13 cases, passed on both package layouts.
- **Latest**: the final eight direct-export and held-assumption cases, passed on both 55-module layouts.
- **Refinement**: three additional cases passed on both recorded 55-module layouts and original Wolfram.

All passing symbolic checks use exact values or exact logical predicates.
The numerical checks below are explicitly limited smoke checks. The full
original MUnit suite is a separate validation target and has not been run in
Mathics. Two inverse-domain fixtures explicitly characterize different runtime
behavior: Wolfram evaluates `InverseFunction` before package dispatch, while
Mathics retains the operator and conservatively rejects an unproved branch.
Their native and Mathics assertions are both checked; neither runtime is skipped.

## Export inventory

Case IDs in this table are exact searchable identifiers in the portable suite.
An infix call covers an overloaded operator; a constructor check covers a
returned data head and its public evaluation behavior.

Exact Newton quadratic inversion is **Refinement**. |
| `AsymptoticLogarithmicInverse` | `logarithmic-reciprocal-core`, `operations-reciprocal-log-differentiate`, `operations-reciprocal-log-compose` | Reciprocal-log blocks for `x+x/Log[x]`, derivative and composition contracts. **Core**, **Operations**. |
| `AsymptoticSpecialInverse` | `operations-special-inverse-quadratic-threshold`, `special-adapter-erfc-tail`, `special-adapter-loggamma-core`, `special-adapter-gamma-core`, `special-adapter-lambert-threshold-branches` | Direct quadratic-threshold adapter with translated source, target offset and negative target scale; exact remainder. **Operations**. The four tail and threshold adapters compare the finite expression numerically at one target each, with their remainders, cutoffs and selected sides; each needs about a minute on Mathics. |
| `FlatSeriesDifferentiate` | `operations-flat-series-calculus-and-error` | Exact derivative of retained first sector and nonzero derivative remainder. **Operations**. |
| `FlatSeriesMultiply` | `operations-flat-series-calculus-and-error`, `flat-graded-product-tail` | Direct multiplication by an exact scalar. **Operations**. The graded case squares the depth-one inverse of `x + Exp[-1/x]` and checks the sector-2 tail power `-1` and `"SectorTailGrade"`. |

| `FlatSeriesTruncate` | `operations-flat-series-calculus-and-error` | Inner truncation removes a displayed flat coefficient and records its nonzero inner remainder. **Operations**. |

| `InverseExpansionCoefficient` | `families-single-index-coefficient`, `operations-empty-inverse-multi-index`, `inverse-coefficient-explicit-power-precedence` | Direct Euler coefficient at index `{2}` with a degree-two formal-log polynomial. **Core**; empty inverse multi-index checked in the later wave-4 batch; an explicit `"Power"` on a result object overrides the stored power. |

The wave-4 checks additionally require sufficient returned precision, explicit Mathics refusals for unavailable 30-digit noninteger roots, and a successful 10-digit request. The local-coordinate case solves a 10-digit request at a `10^100` source offset. This is not a general numerical-stability certificate. |
| `InverseResidual` | `inverse-residual`, `inverse-residual-target-offset-label` | Exact vanished residual below a quadratic inverse cutoff. **Core**. The offset case checks `"TargetOffset"` and the `(f(g(y)) - y0)` label against the zero-offset control. |

| `PerturbativeInverse` | `inverse-perturbative-formula`, `inverse-perturbative-general-core`, `inverse-perturbative-zero-order`, `contracts-perturbative-variables` | Finite formula, nonidentity core, order-zero identity and invalid-variable contract. **Core**, with the explicit normalization reconciliation. |
| `PowerLogModel` | `families-single-index-coefficient`, `assumptions-inline-inverse-and-model-preserve-composite` | Direct model construction for logarithmic coefficients is **Core**; composite-assumption rejection is **Latest**. |

| `SeriesCompose` | `operations-series-compose-transports-inner-error` | Direct composition transports the inner error instead of claiming the larger requested cutoff. **Operations**. |
| `SeriesDifferentiate` | `operations-series-derivative-contract` | Exact logarithmic derivative succeeds; differentiating a truncated series without derivative bounds fails. **Operations**. |
| `SeriesExp` | `operations-series-log-and-exp` | Direct exponential expansion with cubic terms and cutoff four. **Operations**. |
| `SeriesLog` | `operations-series-log-and-exp` | Direct logarithm includes its leading `Log[x]` and three corrections. **Operations**. |
| `SeriesMultiply` | `arithmetic-multiply`, `operations-explicit-series-binary-wrappers` | Infix multiplication is **Core**; direct scalar wrappers in both argument orders are **Latest**. |

| `SeriesRefine` | `arithmetic-refinement`, `arithmetic-refinement-retained-state`, `operations-newton-inverse-and-retained-refinement`, `operations-refinement-additional-blocks-request`, `operations-refinement-replays-product-recipe` | Retained Lagrange state and unchanged original object are **Core**. Retained Newton steps, exact residual, additional complete blocks and product-recipe replay with honest work-count metadata are **Refinement**. |
| `SeriesTruncate` | `arithmetic-truncation`, `operations-series-data-reconstruction`, `special-zeta-truncation-transports-bound` | Direct cutoff reduction is **Core**; explicit remainder data-head equality is **Latest**; the Zeta case checks that truncation transports the absolute tail bound and that a no-op truncation keeps every bound field. |
| `SpecialInverseNumericalCheck` | `operations-special-numerical-exact-threshold`, `special-adapter-erfc-numerical-contract` | Direct exact quadratic-threshold root smoke check; result remains explicitly uncertified. **Latest**. The Erfc contract requires the `10^-20` tail comparison to return either the documented precision refusal or a finite record on Mathics, instead of aborting the evaluator. |

## Remaining input and option coverage

The following are concrete gaps in this portable suite, even where every
export in the relevant area has a representative fixture:

- **Refinement and algorithms.** Grouped Lagrange modes, retained Newton
  refinement for nonlinear observables or nontrivial coordinate charts,
  target/relative-error requests, exact-termination and resource-limited
  additional-block requests, and recipes for more general nested operations
  need their own cases. The tested quadratic Newton and product-replay paths
  do not cover all these modes.
- **Extended-scale operations.** Higher reciprocal-log levels, generalized
  logarithmic coefficient jets, several Fourier frequencies and resonances,
  nonlinear flat observables and products of two nontrivial flat series,
  and arithmetic across factored, Dirichlet, Gamma and Barnes envelopes
  require additional tests. The logarithmic residual API also has an explicit
  unsupported-residual contract for generalized coefficient jets.
- **Special inverse adapters.** The `AsymptoticSpecialInverse` fixtures now
  cover `"QuadraticThreshold"` and one default request of each of `"Erfc"`,
  `"LogGamma"`, `"Gamma"` and `"LambertThreshold"` (both real branches). Their
  `"ModelTerms"`, `"TargetOffset"`, `"TargetScale"` and other chart options,
  resource limits, and the numerical checks of the Gamma-family adapters
  remain distinct targets. Testing `AsymptoticInverse[Gamma[x], ...]` does not
  cover all those public adapter paths.
- **Proof and rejection boundaries.** The suite checks affine-domain realness,
  selected complex and inexact inputs, ambiguous/disconnected branch behavior,
  and held inline assumptions. General nonlinear/disconnected domains,
  arbitrary symbolic assumptions, unsupported special-function parameters,
  and all resource-limited failure paths are not covered. Information already
  lost in an externally evaluated Mathics assumption cannot generally be
  reconstructed by the package's held inline-option adapter.
- **Numerical and certificate behavior.** General high-precision accuracy,
  nonprincipal ProductLog numerical branches, adaptive certificate refinement,
  relative tolerances and nonpolynomial elementary-tail certificates need
  dedicated accuracy and enclosure evidence. An exact-root smoke check does
  not validate these capabilities.
  The later [precision adapter](NUMERICAL.md) explicitly refuses unsupported
  reference-root goals; successful refusal is a tested contract, not a claim
  that Mathics now computes the requested high-precision root.
- **Runtime and presentation.** The portable suite covers clean loading,
  reloads, context isolation and selected evaluator primitives. Notebook
  front-end presentation, other Mathics releases, and all Wolfram language
  evaluation edge cases need separate validation.

Unresolved or conservatively rejected supported Wolfram inputs remain
compatibility work. They are not counted as successful Mathics functionality
merely because the failure is mathematically safe.
